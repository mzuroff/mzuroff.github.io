                    Jellyfish, also known as sea jellies or simply jellies, are the 
                    medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum 
                    Medusozoa, which is a major part of the phylum Cnidaria. Jellyfish are
                     mainly free-swimming marine animals, although a few are anchored to the 
                     seabed by stalks rather than being motile. They are made of an umbrella-
                     shaped main body made of mesoglea, known as the bell, and a collection of 
                     trailing tentacles on the underside.

                <p>
                    Via pulsating contractions, the bell can provide propulsion for locomotion 
                    through open water. The tentacles are armed with stinging cells and may be 
                    used to capture prey or to defend against predators. Jellyfish have a complex 
                    life cycle, and the medusa is normally the sexual phase, which produces planula 
                    larvae. These then disperse widely and enter a sedentary polyp phase which may
                     include asexual budding before reaching sexual maturity.

                    The main feature of a true jellyfish is the umbrella-shaped bell. This is a hollow 
                    structure consisting of a mass of transparent jelly-like matter known as mesoglea,
                    which forms the hydrostatic skeleton of the animal.[25] The mesoglea is 95% or more 
                    composed of water,[30] and also contains collagen and other fibrous proteins, as well
                    as wandering amebocytes that can engulf debris and bacteria. The mesogloea is bordered 
                    by the epidermis on the outside and the gastrodermis on the inside. The edge of the bell
                    is often divided into rounded lobes known as lappets, which allow the bell to flex. In the
                    gaps or niches between the lappets are dangling rudimentary sense organs known as rhopalia,
                    and the margin of the bell often bears tentacles.
