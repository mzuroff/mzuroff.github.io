            <b>Crown Shyness</b>
            (also
            <i>
                canopy disengagement,[<sup>1</sup>] canopy shyness,
                [<sup>2</sup>] or inter-crown spacing[<sup>3</sup>]
            </i>
            ) 
            is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the 
            crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming
            a canopy with channel-like gaps.[<sup>4</sup>][<sup>5</sup>] 
            The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, 
            but also occurs between trees of different species.[<sup>6</sup>]
            [<sup>7</sup>] There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness
            is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit 
            spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[<sup>8</sup>]
